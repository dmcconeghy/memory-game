# memory-game

This project was completed for the 4th unit of my Springboard Software Engineering bootcamp. Focusing on DOM manipulation, this game demonstrates my ability to control HTML elements with JavaScript. It also features working local storage for high scores, dynamic tile creation, and a fun sense of my design style.
