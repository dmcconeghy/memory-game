# memory-game

This project was completed for the 4th unit of my Springboard Software Engineering bootcamp. Focusing on DOM manipulation, this game demonstrates my ability to create and control HTML DOM elements with JavaScript. Future updates could include a turn counter, a localStorage best score, and numerous style improvements.
